This is a manual of operations for the Agios Informatics team. Its purpose is to:

1. Provide a resource on best practices to follow when setting up and working on projects, this includes skills such as version control and code guidelines. 
2. Aid and provide complete examples on setting up effective and reproducible project workflows using Workflowr (https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/index.html). This guide walks through exactly how to setup Workflowr which will automatically link your work to GitLab and allow you to easily see your past versions and updates right in RStudio.
3. Promote learning and sharing of ideas along with allowing your projects to be easily reproduced and used by others in the future. A variety of tools are presented here which may be useful and customizable for the particular project you are working on.
